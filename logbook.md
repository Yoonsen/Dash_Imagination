# ImagiNation Development Logbook

## Overview
This logbook tracks the development progress, decisions, and challenges of the ImagiNation project. It serves as a living document to maintain continuity between development sessions and track the evolution of the project.

## Current Sprint
**Period**: May 15-20, 2024
**Focus**: Place Search and Highlight Feature

## Active Tasks
- [x] Place Search implementation
- [x] Map centering functionality
- [x] Corpus management improvements

## Recent Decisions
- Implemented global `current_dhlabids` list as single source of truth for corpus management
- Simplified corpus handling by removing redundant filtering logic
- Improved consistency between map data and place details

## Technical Challenges
- Resolved inconsistency between book counts and displayed books in place details
- Fixed corpus sampling issues by implementing global corpus management
- Improved SQLite query handling for large corpora

## Development Log

### May 15, 2024
**Progress**:
- Implemented global corpus management system
- Fixed inconsistencies in place details display
- Improved corpus sampling logic

**Key Changes**:
1. Added global `current_dhlabids` list for corpus management
2. Modified `get_places_for_map` and `get_place_details` to use global corpus
3. Updated corpus upload and reset functionality
4. Improved logging for better debugging

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor performance with large corpora
- Consider adding corpus modification features
- Plan for additional corpus analysis tools

## Testing Notes
- Verified consistency between book counts and displayed books
- Tested with both uploaded and sampled corpora
- Confirmed proper handling of large corpora

## User Feedback
*To be added after user testing*

## Performance Monitoring
*To be added as metrics are collected*

## Notes
- Update this logbook regularly with significant changes
- Include both technical and user-facing changes
- Document any challenges and their solutions

## 2024-03-19: Improved Cluster Visualization
- Added polygon visualization for clusters when clicked
- Implemented convex hull for clusters with 3+ points
- Added oval visualization for 2-point clusters
- Fixed polygon edge handling for clusters spanning map boundaries
- Improved polygon completeness by adding edge points and ensuring closure
- Adjusted cluster visualization to better represent spatial distribution of places
